               component. They directly impact the spatial and temporal
               resolution, sensitivity, and uniformity in MRI. Advances in RF
               hardware have resulted in a variety of designs optimized for
               specific clinical applications. RF coils are the ``antennas'' of
               the MRI system and have two functions: first, to excite the
               magnetization by broadcasting the RF power (Tx-Coil) and second
               to receive the signal from the excited spins (Rx-Coil). Transmit
               RF Coils emit magnetic field pulses ( B1+) to rotate the net
               magnetization away from its alignment with the main magnetic
               field (B0 ), resulting in a transverse precessing magnetization.
               Due to the precession around the static main magnetic field, the
               magnetic flux in the receive RF Coil ( B1-) changes, which
               generates a current I. This signal is ``picked-up'' by an
               antenna and preamplified, usually mixed down to a lower
               frequency, digitized, and processed by a computer to finally
               reconstruct an image or a spectrum. Transmit and receive
               functionality can be combined in one RF Coil (Tx/Rx Coils). This
               review looks at the fundamental principles of an MRI RF coil
               from the perspective of clinicians and MR technicians and

              and subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus. Because of the
              many extant and highly discrepant segmentation protocols,
              comparing results across studies is difficult. To overcome this
              barrier, the Hippocampal Subfields Group was formed as an

              parahippocampal subregions on high-resolution MRI. In this
              commentary we discuss the goals for this protocol and the
              associated key challenges involved in its development. These
              include differences among existing anatomical reference
              materials, striking the right balance between reliability of
              measurements and anatomical validity, and the development of a
              versatile protocol that can be adopted for the study of
              populations varying in age and health. The commentary outlines
              these key challenges, as well as the proposed solution of each,
              with concrete examples from our working plan. Finally, with two
              examples, we illustrate how the harmonized protocol, once
              completed, is expected to impact the field by producing
              measurements that are quantitatively comparable across labs and
              by facilitating the synthesis of findings across different
              studies. \copyright{} 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

               volumes and volume change during follow-up intervals of 12 or 24

              Neonate magnetic resonance (MR) images have different contrasts

              magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can thus be considered

              most anatomical regions are identifiable and thus amenable to
              manual segmentation. In the current study, we developed a
              protocol for segmenting the amygdala and hippocampus in
              T2-weighted neonatal MR images. The participants were 31 healthy
              infants between 2 and 5 weeks of age. Intra-rater reliability was
              measured in 12 randomly selected MR images, where 6 MR images
              were segmented at 1-month intervals between the delineations, and
              another 6 MR images at 6-month intervals. The protocol was also
              tested by two independent raters in 20 randomly selected

              and auditory cortices were measured in subjects performing finger
              tapping while listening to metronome pacing tones. A repeated
              trial paradigm was used with stimulus durations of 167 ms to 16 s
              and intertrial times of 30 s. Both cortical systems were found to
              be nonlinear in that the response to a long stimulus could not be
              predicted by convolving the 1-s response with a rectangular
              function. In the short-time regime, the amplitude of the response
              varied only slowly with stimulus duration. It was found that this
              character was predicted with a modification to Buxton's balloon
              model. Wiener deconvolution was used to deblur the response to
              concatenated short episodes of finger tapping at different
              temporal separations and at rates from 1 to 4 Hz. While the
              measured response curves were distorted by overlap between the
              individual episodes, the deconvolved response at each rate was
              found to agree well with separate scans at each of the individual
              rates. Thus, although the impulse response cannot predict the
              response to fully overlapping stimuli, linear deconvolution is
              effective when the stimuli are separated by at least 4 s. The
              deconvolution filter must be measured for each subject using a
              short-stimulus paradigm. It is concluded that deconvolution may
              be effective in diminishing the hemodynamically imposed temporal

              responses in eventrelated fMRI.",

               anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), consistently show greater
               activity during resting states than during cognitive tasks. This
               finding led to the hypothesis that these regions constitute a
               network supporting a default mode of brain function. In this
               study, we investigate three questions pertaining to this
               hypothesis: Does such a resting-state network exist in the human
               brain? Is it modulated during simple sensory processing? How is
               it modulated during cognitive processing? To address these
               questions, we defined PCC and vACC regions that showed decreased
               activity during a cognitive (working memory) task, then examined
               their functional connectivity during rest. PCC was strongly
               coupled with vACC and several other brain regions implicated in
               the default mode network. Next, we examined the functional
               connectivity of PCC and vACC during a visual processing task and
               show that the resultant connectivity maps are virtually
               identical to those obtained during rest. Last, we defined three
               lateral prefrontal regions showing increased activity during the
               cognitive task and examined their resting-state connectivity. We
               report significant inverse correlations among all three lateral

               attenuation of default mode network activity during cognitive

               fluctuations in functional-MRI (fMRI) signals in humans in the

               blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signal are often
               synchronized over distant parts of the brain, a phenomenon
               termed functional-connectivity. Functional-connectivity is
               widely assumed to reflect interregional coherence of
               fluctuations in activity of the underlying neuronal networks.
               Despite the large body of human imaging literature on
               spontaneous activity and functional-connectivity in the resting
               state, the link to underlying neural activity remains tenuous.
               Through simultaneous fMRI and intracortical neurophysiological
               recording, we demonstrate correlation between slow fluctuations
               in BOLD signals and concurrent fluctuations in the underlying
               locally measured neuronal activity. This correlation varied with
               time-lag of BOLD relative to neuronal activity, resembling a
               traditional hemodynamic response function with peaks at
               approximately 6 s lag of BOLD signal. The correlations were
               reliably detected when the neuronal signal consisted of either
               the spiking rate of a small group of neurons, or relative power
               changes in the multi-unit activity band, and particularly in the
               local field potential gamma band. Analysis of correlation
               between the voxel-by-voxel fMRI time-series and the neuronal
               activity measured within one cortical site showed patterns of
               correlation that slowly traversed cortex. BOLD fluctuations in
               widespread areas in visual cortex of both hemispheres were
               significantly correlated with neuronal activity from a single
               recording site in V1. To the extent that our V1 findings can be
               generalized to other cortical areas, fMRI-based
               functional-connectivity between remote regions in the resting

               external attention and are active during remembering,
               envisioning the future and making social inferences. This Review
               describes progress in understanding the organization and
               function of networks embedded within these association regions.
               Detailed high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest
               that the default network is not a single network, as
               historically described, but instead comprises multiple
               interwoven networks. The multiple networks share a common
               organizational motif (also evident in marmoset and macaque
               anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of
               processing function dependent on internally constructed rather
               than externally constrained representations, with each separate
               interwoven network specialized for a distinct processing domain.
               Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal evidence
               for competitive relationships between the internally and

              show significant differences across the active task states within
              an experiment, but a verb-generation task produced larger
              decreases than a read task in right and left inferior parietal

               challenge. Many suspect that left unconstrained, its activity
               will vary unpredictably. Despite this prediction we identify a
               baseline state of the normal adult human brain in terms of the
               brain oxygen extraction fraction or OEF. The OEF is defined as
               the ratio of oxygen used by the brain to oxygen delivered by
               flowing blood and is remarkably uniform in the awake but resting
               state (e.g., lying quietly with eyes closed). Local deviations
               in the OEF represent the physiological basis of signals of
               changes in neuronal activity obtained with functional MRI during
               a wide variety of human behaviors. We used quantitative
               metabolic and circulatory measurements from positron-emission
               tomography to obtain the OEF regionally throughout the brain.
               Areas of activation were conspicuous by their absence. All
               significant deviations from the mean hemisphere OEF were
               increases, signifying deactivations, and resided almost
               exclusively in the visual system. Defining the baseline state of
               an area in this manner attaches meaning to a group of areas that

  abstract = "Information processing in the cerebral cortex involves
              interactions among distributed areas. Anatomical connectivity
              suggests that certain areas form local hierarchical relations
              such as within the visual system. Other connectivity patterns,
              particularly among association areas, suggest the presence of
              large-scale circuits without clear hierarchical relations. In
              this study the organization of networks in the human cerebrum was
              explored using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Data
              from 1,000 subjects were registered using surface-based
              alignment. A clustering approach was employed to identify and
              replicate networks of functionally coupled regions across the
              cerebral cortex. The results revealed local networks confined to
              sensory and motor cortices as well as distributed networks of
              association regions. Within the sensory and motor cortices,
              functional connectivity followed topographic representations
              across adjacent areas. In association cortex, the connectivity
              patterns often showed abrupt transitions between network
              boundaries. Focused analyses were performed to better understand
              properties of network connectivity. A canonical sensory-motor
              pathway involving primary visual area, putative middle temporal
              area complex (MT+), lateral intraparietal area, and frontal eye
              field was analyzed to explore how interactions might arise within
              and between networks. Results showed that adjacent regions of the
              MT+ complex demonstrate differential connectivity consistent with
              a hierarchical pathway that spans networks. The functional
              connectivity of parietal and prefrontal association cortices was
              next explored. Distinct connectivity profiles of neighboring
              regions suggest they participate in distributed networks that,
              while showing evidence for interactions, are embedded within
              largely parallel, interdigitated circuits. We conclude by
              discussing the organization of these large-scale cerebral
              networks in relation to monkey anatomy and their potential
              evolutionary expansion in humans to support cognition.",

              the premotor area and the lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as
              the frontal longitudinal system (FLS). This study investigated
              the existence of a direct segment (none U-fibre) of the superior
              part of the FLS (sFLS), which connects the dorsal premotor cortex
              (PMd) and DLPFC and analysed its asymmetry and termination point
              patterns. A dataset of diffusion-weighted images from 48 subjects
              was used for generalised q-sampling imaging tractography.
              Additionally, a white-fibre dissection was conducted in two right
              hemispheres. An analysis of spatial location, termination points,
              laterality, and correlation with the subjects' gender or
              handedness was performed. The sFLS was found to have a deeper
              longitudinal bundle directly connecting the PMd and DLPFC. The
              bundle is referred to hereafter as the superior frontal
              longitudinal tract (SFLT). The SFLT was reconstructed in 100\% of
              right and 88\% of left hemispheres. It exhibited variable
              patterns in different subjects in their posterior terminations.
              In addition, it was found to possess a complicated spatial
              relationship with the adjacent bundles. The SFLT was revealed
              successfully in two cadaveric right hemispheres, where the
              posterior terminations were found to originate in the PMd
              independent of the superior longitudinal fasciculus.",

  abstract = "The vertical occipital fasciculus (VOF) is an association fiber
              tract coursing vertically at the posterolateral corner of the
              brain. It is re-evaluated as a major fiber tract to link the
              dorsal and ventral visual stream. Although previous tractography
              studies showed the VOF's cortical projections fall in the dorsal
              and ventral visual areas, the post-mortem dissection study for
              the validation remains limited. First, to validate the previous
              tractography data, we here performed the white matter dissection
              in post-mortem brains and demonstrated the VOF's fiber bundles
              coursing between the V3A/B areas and the posterior fusiform
              gyrus. Secondly, we analyzed the VOF's structural connectivity
              with diffusion tractography to link vision-associated cortical
              areas of the HCP MMP1.0 atlas, an updated map of the human
              cerebral cortex. Based on the criteria the VOF courses laterally
              to the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF) and craniocaudally
              at the posterolateral corner of the brain, we reconstructed the
              VOF's fiber tracts and found the widespread projections to the
              visual cortex. These findings could suggest a crucial role of VOF
              in integrating visual information to link the broad visual cortex
              as well as in connecting the dual visual stream.",
